# Always-on personal station (AoPS)

If you don't know what to do with the tablet your grandmother gave you 10 years ago, then this is the project you need.

This app features full-page modules, which you can add and sort freely. See the "available modules" section for the full list. 

The app jumps automatically between modules and shows progressBars. The time spent on each module can be edited.

 - Live weather (using OpenWeatherMap API)
	 -  Weather
	 - Temperature
	 - Wind
	 - Location
	 - Next hour precipitation
	 - Severe wind and temperatures badges

## Compatibility

This app works on all modern browsers, and on Internet Explorer 11. Yes, you can give a new life to your Microsoft Surface RT (which is why I made the app originally ðŸ˜„)

## Roadmap

 - [ ] Insert screenshots in Readme
 - [ ] Create a favicon
 - [ ] Insert a location selector to avoid filling the coordinates (Weather)
 - [ ] More than one module instance (manage Refs automatically)
 - [ ] Create an onboarding process, showing tips and how to setup modules
 - [ ] Manage translations

##  Usage instructions

All the data you set (location, API keys, ...) is stored locally in your browser, there is no collection, no database, your privacy is respected.

### Use project locally

You can use your own local version of the app. For this, you need a Node.JS development environment.

- Clone the project in a dedicated directory on your computer
- [Install yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) (if not already installed)
- Run `yarn` to install packages
- Run `yarn start` to start the project. It will open a tab in your browser. If not, browse `http://localhost:3000` to see the app.

This app is made using React. To learn React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).
